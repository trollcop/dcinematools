#summary Building asdcp-lib under Visual Studio 2008
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Prerequisites =

  * [http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html OpenSSL-Win32] - download ~8MB Installer edition of latest version
  * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/files/ expat XML Parser] - download 2.0.1 .tgz
  * Xerces-C is no longer recommended as it does not properly work (on Windows, anyway).

= Building =

 # Make a dir, ex. d:\sdk
 # Install OpenSSL somewhere, ex d:\sdk\OpenSSL. Add *OpenSSL\include* to VC include path, add *OpenSSL\lib\VC\static* to VC Lib path.
 # Unzip expat and put in *d:\sdk\expat
 # Import 'expat.dsw' into current Visual Studio.
 # Build 'Release' of 'expat_static' project.
 # Unzip asdcp build files into d:\sdk\asdcp
 # Download latest [http://www.cinecert.com/asdcplib/ asdcp-lib] and copy contents of 'src' dir into d:\sdk\asdcp\src.
 # Build 'Release' of asdcp.
 # Find release bits in asdcp\Release

This results in static MT runtime, manifest-less build of asdcp-lib and asdcp-test.exe
