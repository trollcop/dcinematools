#summary MXFSource usage

= Introduction =

MXFSource is an [http://avisynth.org/ AviSynth] plugin to load clear or encrypted MXF containing 2D or 3D JP2K or PCM essence for editing.

*Note*: Because AviSynth does not support XYZ12 color space, JP2K decode output is limited to RGB32.

For proper XYZ12 to RGB conversion, [http://www.mainconcept.com/products/sdks/video/jpeg-2000.html Main Concept JPEG2000 SDK] dec_j2k.dll is recommended, otherwise [http://www.openjpeg.org/ OpenJPEG] is used.

= Installation =

 * Copy MXFSource.dll to AviSynth plugins dir
 * _optional_ Copy *dec_j2k.dll* (from MainConcept SDK) to same dir.
